The ``megalodon_extras modified_bases`` command group contains various commands related to modified base processing within Megalodon.

-----------------------------------------------------
``megalodon_extras modified_bases describe_alphabet``
-----------------------------------------------------

Describe the alphabet, including modified bases, found in a given model.

This command is useful to determine the syntax for specifying arguments related to modified base detection.

Note that originally modified bases were specified by arbitrary values, but recent and future models will attempt to follow single letter codes specified by `samtools hts-spec (currently an open issue) <https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/pull/418>`_.

A minimal subset of the model specifications from the main ``megalodon`` command are available to specify the model exactly as in the main command.
The model will be loaded as normal and the alphabet used will be printed.

------------------------------------------------------
``megalodon_extras modified_bases estimate_threshold``
------------------------------------------------------

Estimate the optimal global modified base score threshold such that the estimated proportion of bases modified is achieved when all sites are called.
This command is useful when producing the ``signal_mappings`` or ``per_read_refs`` outputs with modified bases annotated for basecaller training with Taiyaki.

This command works by estimating the proportion of bases modified from a sample using the most extreme calls (default most extreme 8%; set with ``--mod-percentile`` option) as a truth set.
This method assumes that the distribution of modified base and canonical scores is approximately balanced.
This may not be true for all models.
The plots produced by the ``megalodon_extras calibrate modified_bases`` command can assist in making this determination.

---------------------------------------------------
``megalodon_extras modified_bases update_database``
---------------------------------------------------

The Megalodon modified base database schema was updated at the release of Megalodon 2.0.
This command is provided in order to update a database from Megalodon <2.0 for use with Megalodon >=2.0.

-------------------------------------------------------
``megalodon_extras modified_bases create_ground_truth``
-------------------------------------------------------

Create a set of ground truth sites from a bedmethyl file.
This is a convenience command to apply a threshold to observed fractions of modified bases from bedmethyl files produced by Megalodon or other software.

The ``--strand-offset`` is provided to allow calls on opposite strands to be combined.
For example forward and reverse strand CpG calls can be merged by setting ``--strand-offset 1`` since the reverse strand position ``1`` downstream of the forward strand position correspond to the same biological methylation event.
